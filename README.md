#Welcome to Lawrence Lee Art

This Chrome Browser New Tab extension is free for you to use.

When installed, this extension will show you all or part of one of my recent paintings along with a quote from one of my poems or published articles every time you create a new tab in Chrome.  Images and quotes are chosen randomly from files linked to this extension.

If you would like me to create such an extension for your work, with or without quotes, please send me an email with "NewTab Info" in the subject line, addressed to lawrence@lawrenceleeart.com.  I'll reply with full instructions on how to get started, pricing, and additional information.  Functionality for this development is still being created.  

If you have questions about my work or about this extension, email me at lawrence@lawrenceleeart.com.

You can always see my latest work on my website at https://lawrenceleeart.com.

Thank you for your interest.
